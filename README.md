# Pizza Order

This is the resulting repository for the test driven PizzaOrder class. For
practice, try deleting the implementation file, and getting all the tests to
pass on your own.

## Getting started

Run the following in your terminal:  
`git clone git@github.com:wvmitchell/pizza-order-tdd.git`  
`cd pizza-order-tdd`  
`npm install`  
`npm test`
